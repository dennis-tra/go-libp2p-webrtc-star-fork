# Echo client-server

The example consists of two parts - client and server. The server exposes basic *echo* handler that echoes back client's messages.

Star server https://wrtc-star1.par.dwebops.pub/ is used for signalling purpose.

## Getting started

Run server:

```bash
$ go get github.com/dennis-tra/go-libp2p-webrtc-star/examples/echo/server
$ server
2019/09/03 12:39:24 Server host ID: QmZrEj3jgeF3vUAxPVRSyk1QnZQBbQDNMJqXauLwh6knVr
```

Please note the server host ID and spawn client:
```bash
$ go get github.com/dennis-tra/go-libp2p-webrtc-star/examples/echo/client
$ client QmZrEj3jgeF3vUAxPVRSyk1QnZQBbQDNMJqXauLwh6knVr
```

Give some time to both endpoints to setup and start handling network stream. You're good to go!

## Sample session

The session has been established between a server running behind a couple of corporate NATs and client deployed on a shared shell account (different locations, VPNs, firewalls):

**Server**:

```bash
$ server
2019/09/03 12:39:24 Server host ID: QmZrEj3jgeF3vUAxPVRSyk1QnZQBbQDNMJqXauLwh6knVr
